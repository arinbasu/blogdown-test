Hi, my name is Arindam Basu and I am an academic at the University of Canterbury's School of Health Sciences. This blog is about data science and tutorial texts and various other bits. I also blog in 
[Medium](http://medium.com/@arinbasu), and my official university page is here:
[Arin Basu's UC page](http://www.canterbury.ac.nz/spark/Researcher.aspx?researcherid=2821344)

This page is made possible by:

 [**blogdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) package. The theme was forked from [@jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme](https://github.com/jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme) and modified by [Yihui Xie](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-lithium-theme).
